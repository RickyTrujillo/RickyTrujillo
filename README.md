## Ricardo Trujillo - Data Analyst Portfolio

# About
Hi, I am Ricardo or I also go by Ricky! I obtained my M.S. in Mathematics with an emphasis in Statistics in addition to a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I've tailored my academic journey to prepare me for the Data Analyst/Data Scientist domain. I have a strong foundation in coding with R, Python, and SQL and paired with a passion for leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights. I am thrilled to have the many experience along my academic journey so that I can continue strengthening my skillset as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies, I've rigorously tested my ability to work with complex datasets and developed a strong sense for applying and analyzing statistical models. My experiences have extensively ensured I perform data preprocessing procedures, plan and develop models, analyze results, and identify limitations. I've dabbled in different domains and I believe my ability to consult with other domain-knowledge experts allows me to be a beneficial asset and be versatile in my sought out role. 

Outside of my academic journey, my position as a Data and Systems Intern allows me to carry out the aforementioned skills along with consistently showcasing my profieciency in data management and visualizations with SQL and Tableau, respectively. I enjoy exploring new and challenging opportunities and this position allows me to branch out and learn new tools and techniques, constantly expanding my knowledge and skills. Whether I am working on a team or independently, I am driven to reach organization goals set and provide meaningful deliverables. 

In this repository, I hope to showcase my skills, share my public projects, and track my Data Analytics/Data Science journey!
